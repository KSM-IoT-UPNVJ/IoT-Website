    "description": "The Smart Home Prototype is an IoT-based system designed to enhance comfort, efficiency, and sustainability in everyday living. It utilizes sensors to detect occupancy within a home and automatically adjusts the fan speed according to the number of people present. This adaptive approach ensures that energy is used more effectively, reducing unnecessary power consumption while maintaining a pleasant indoor environment. By integrating automation with real-time data, the system demonstrates how technology can transform traditional households into intelligent living spaces.\n\nBeyond occupancy detection, the prototype also incorporates environmental monitoring through temperature and humidity sensors. These sensors control the automatic opening and closing of windows, ensuring optimal airflow and indoor air quality. As a result, the system not only improves comfort but also contributes to healthier living conditions. With its combination of smart energy management and environmental responsiveness, this prototype represents an innovative step toward creating homes that are both user-friendly and eco-friendly.",
